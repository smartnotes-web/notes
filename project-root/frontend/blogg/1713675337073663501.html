            <h1 class="main_topic">Theory of Communication</h1>

            <p>&#8618; <b><strong class="black">Communication</strong></b> is arguably one of the most important aspects
                of life, whether it
                is
                the
                dark ages or modern-day life.</p>
            <p>&#8618; It is a way to share experiences, ideas, thoughts, and information.</p>
            <p>&#8618; It is what connects us all together.</p>
            <p>&#8618; When we utter the word <b><strong class="black">"communication"</strong></b>, we are
                traditionally thinking about
                speaking
                and listening but in
                reality, communication consists of several activities such as reading, writing, understanding,
                responding as well as speaking and listening.</p>



            <h2 class="sub_topic">Definitions of Communication</h2>

            <ol>

                <li>Communication is the activity of conveying information through the exchange of thoughts,
                    messages,
                    or information, as by speech, visuals, signals, writing or behaviour. It is the meaningful
                    exchange
                    of information between two groups or a group of persons.</li>
                <li>The act or an instance of communicating; the impairing or exchange of information, ideas, or
                    feelings.</li>
                <li>A process by which information is exchanged between individuals through a common system of
                    symbols, signs, or behaviour.</li>
                <li>Communication is a process of exchanging ideas, thoughts, information, knowledge, etc. between
                    sender and receiver through accepted codes.</li>
                <li>Communication is the activity or process of exchanging ideas and feelings or giving people
                    information.</li>

            </ol>


            <h2 class="sub_topic">Process of Communication</h2>

            <ol>

                <li><strong>Ideation:</strong> The first step of communication is for the sender to have an idea.
                    This idea has to be
                    sent to the receiver through a proper channel. This first step is called ideation.</li>
                <li><strong>Encoding:</strong> The idea has to be converted into a message which can then be
                    transmitted, through proper
                    symbols and signs which must be proper and comprehensible to the receiver. This step is called
                    encoding.</li>
                <li><strong>Channel:</strong> The message must be transmitted through proper channel media/channels.
                    The sender must be
                    extremely careful while selecting the mode of transmission so that there aren't any changes or
                    miscommunication.</li>
                <li><strong>Decoding:</strong> In this step, the receiver receives the message sent by the sender
                    and then understands
                    the original idea. To do this, the receiver will decode the message. This process is called
                    decoding. After decoding the message, the idea reaches to the receiver.</li>
                <li><strong>Receiving:</strong> The last step in the one-way process of communication is receiving
                    the idea which the
                    sender earlier had in his mind.</li>
                <li><strong>Feedback:</strong> In this step of communication, the receiver now has to become the
                    sender and convey back
                    to the sender that the message has been received. They have to go through all the above steps to
                    send their feedback to the earlier sender who is now the receiver. This is the most important
                    step
                    as it ensures completion of the cycle of communication.</li>

            </ol>


            <h2 class="sub_topic">Levels of Communication</h2>

            <ol>

                <li><strong>Extra staff:</strong> This level of communication takes place between humans and other
                    species. Example: your
                    cat coming near you or when you pet them.</li>
                <li><strong>Intrapersonal:</strong> This level of communication takes place within an individual.
                    Self-motivation is an
                    excellent example of intrapersonal communication. Examples: while preparing for an examination,
                    we
                    reassure ourselves with words like 'you can do it' and 'you are prepared'.</li>
                <li><strong>Interpersonal:</strong> This level of communication occurs between human beings. In this
                    level of
                    communication, the roles of sender and receiver change constantly. Sharing information,
                    exchanging
                    ideas and negotiating are all examples of interpersonal communication.</li>
                <li><strong>Organisational:</strong> This level of communication takes place between and within
                    organisations. In this
                    type of communication, networks of communications may vary.</li>
                <li><strong>Mass:</strong> This is when the sender has to reach out to a large mass of people.
                    Examples of this type of
                    <strong class="black">communication are:</strong> announcements, information sent out through
                    pamphlets,
                    advertisements, etc. In
                    this level, the sender selects an appropriate medium such as newspapers, books, magazines, etc.
                    to
                    reach to the masses.
                </li>

            </ol>


            <h2 class="sub_topic">Verbal and Non-Verbal Communication</h2>

            <p>&#8618; There are two major types of communication: <strong class="black">verbal</strong> and
                <strong class="black">non-verbal</strong> communication.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Verbal communication</strong> is the type of communication in which words are used
                    either in oral or written
                    form.</li>
                <li><strong>Non-verbal communication</strong> is the type of communication in which words are not
                    used.</li>
            </ul>



            <h2 class="sub_topic">Components of Non-Verbal Communication</h2>

            <ol>

                <li><strong>Kinesis:</strong> In kinesis, the movement of our body conveys many different and
                    specific
                    meanings whose interpretation may be culture-bound. Since many of these movements occur
                    unconsciously or subconsciously, there is a significantly larger risk of misinterpretation.</li>
                <li><strong>Proxemics:</strong> Proxemics means distance. The measure of distance we keep from
                    others
                    conveys the relationship we share with them or the subject we are discussing.</li>
                <li><strong>Chronemics:</strong> Chronemics deal with time, pauses, and stops which play a
                    significant
                    role while communicating.</li>
                <li><strong>Paralanguage:</strong> Paralanguage deals with vocal qualities such as volume, tone,
                    rate,
                    pronunciation, pitch and intonation patterns.</li>
                <li><strong>Appearance:</strong> The appearance of a person during the course of communication
                    reflects
                    upon the person's personality as well as effectiveness of the overall communication.</li>

            </ol>


            <h2 class="sub_topic">Barriers to Communication</h2>

            <ul>

                <li><strong>Semantic/Linguistic Barrier:</strong> When the speaker uses words or language which the
                    listener does not understand correctly, a linguistic barrier is formed.</li>
                <li><strong>Physical Barrier:</strong> Physical barriers to communication are created by elements
                    such
                    as noise, distance, physical discomfort, etc.</li>
                <li><strong>Interpersonal Barrier:</strong> If the attitude of the speaker and the listener does not
                    synchronize, an interpersonal barrier is created.</li>
                <li><strong>Psychological Barrier:</strong> Elements such as one's emotions and/or attitude can form
                    psychological barriers.</li>
                <li><strong>Organisational Barriers:</strong> Sometimes, in an organization, there might be
                    communication loss due to poor flow of communication, poorly planned infrastructure, or
                    information
                    overload.</li>
                <li><strong>Mechanical Barrier:</strong> Many mechanical factors may be responsible for the break in
                    the
                    communication process.</li>
                <li><strong>Socio-Cultural Barrier:</strong> The source of socio-cultural barriers may be caste
                    divide,
                    class conflict, cross-cultural differences, socio-cultural codes and conducts.</li>
