            <h2 class="sub_topic">Heat and Thermometry</h2>
            <p>&#8618; The terms temperature and heat are often used with the same meaning in everyday life. But in
                physics, these two terms have very different meanings. Heat is a form of energy which can be converted
                into any type of energy.</p>
            <p>&#8618; The unit of heat is <b>joule</b> in the <b>SI system</b>.</p>
            <p>&#8618; The <b>CGS unit</b> is <b>erg</b>. </p>
            <p>&#8618; It is also <b>measured</b> in <b>calorie</b>.</p>

            <p>&#8618; <strong>Definition of Heat (Heat energy):</strong> It is the transfer of energy between two
                objects or an object and its surroundings due to temperature difference.</p>
            <p>&#8618; <strong>Definition of calorie:</strong> It is the required heat energy to raise the temperature
                of 1 g of pure water through 14.5°C to 15.5°C. The bigger unit is 1 kilo calorie = 1000 calorie. As we
                add more and more heat to a body, its temperature goes on increasing.</p>
            <p>&#8618; <strong>Definition of Kilo calorie:</strong> The amount of heat required to increase the
                temperature of one kilogram of pure water from 14.5°C to 15.5°C is called one kilo calorie. One
                thousandth part of one kilo calorie is called one calorie.</p>
            <p>&#8618; <strong>Temperature:</strong>The degree or intensity of heat present in a substance or object,
                especially as expressed according to a comparative scale and shown by a thermometer.</p>

            <h2 class="sub_topic">Modes of Transfer of Heat</h2>
            <p>&#8618; There are <b>three</b> different modes of transfer of heat, namely</p>
            <ol>
                <b>
                    <li>Conduction</li>
                </b>
                <b>
                    <li>Convection</li>
                </b>
                <b>
                    <li>Radiation</li>
                </b>
            </ol>

            <h2 class="sub_topic">Conduction:</h2>
            <p>
                &#8618; The process in which heat is transferred along a body, from a part of higher temperature to that
                at lower temperature without bodily movement of the particles of the medium is called conduction.
            </p>
            <p>
                &#8618; When a metal rod is heated at one end, the opposite end of the rod gets heated after some time.
                In this case, the molecules of the rod do not move from their positions, but the heat travels from one
                end of the rod to the other.
            </p>
            <p>
                &#8618; The process of conduction is explained on the basis of the dynamical theory of heat as follows.
            </p>
            <p>
                &#8618;The molecules of every solid are continuously vibrating about their mean positions. The
                vibrations of molecules increase with the supply of energy.
            </p>
            <p>
                &#8618;The molecules of the metal rod near the source of heat are the first to receive heat. As soon as
                they receive heat, they begin to vibrate vigorously. These molecules collide with the molecules in the
                neighboring layer and part with some of the heat energy possessed by them. Having received additional
                energy, the molecules in this layer also begin to vibrate vigorously and in turn give some of the energy
                with them to the next ones. In this way, heat travels along the rod.
            </p>
            <p>
                &#8618;The molecules of the solids are held rigidly in their mean position, hence conduction is the only
                mode of transfer to the heat in solid.
            </p>


            <h2 class="sub_topic">Convection:</h2>
            <p>
                &#8618; In thermal convection, the constituent particles actually move from one place to another. This
                fact indicates that convection is observed only in gases and liquids i.e., fluids. It is also true that
                in fluid thermal conduction plays a very small part in heat transfer.
            </p>
            <p>
                &#8618; In convection, fluid at the bottom becomes hot and so its volume increases, due to which its
                density decreases. So due to buoyant force, this 'lighter' fluid moves upwards and due to gravitational
                effect the fluid with greater density is transferred from the top to the bottom. Due to such a
                continuous process, the fluid is heated. If you add potassium permanganate into water while heating it
                in a flask, you can observe this phenomenon.
            </p>
            <p>
                &#8618; Convection can be natural as well as forced. If the motion of the material is only due to the
                difference in density it is natural convection e.g., 'cool current' near a sea shore. The soil becomes
                hot due to sun rays and so the air in contact with this soil also gets heated and its volume increases
                and its density decreases. So this air is moving up. So the air pressure near the soil reduces due to
                which the cool air from sea side rushes towards the soil. Thus cool currents of air are formed. During
                the night, it reverses.

            </p>
            <p>
                &#8618;In forced convection, a fluid is forced to move using some appliance, like a pump, or a stirrer.
                In the human body, the heart acts as a pump for blood circulation. Due to this blood circulation, body
                temperature is maintained.
            </p>

            <h2 class="sub_topic">Anomalous Expansion of Water:</h2>
            <p>
                &#8618; The volume of water increases instead of decreasing when the temperature of water is reduced
                from <b>4°C to 0°C</b>. This is called anomalous expansion of water. The existence of fish and other
                aquatic animals is possible because of natural convection and anomalous expansion of water. In winter,
                temperature decreases, the upper layer of water converts into ice and stops the heat from below layers
                to the atmosphere. So below the ice layer, there is a temperature at <b>4°C</b> and fish and other
                aquatic animals can survive.
            </p>


            <h2 class="sub_topic">Radiation:</h2>
            <p>
                &#8618; Every substance emits electromagnetic radiation of certain frequencies in accordance with its
                temperature. These radiations are thermal radiations. Thermal radiations are electromagnetic radiations
                only. The energy associated with these electromagnetic radiation is called radiant energy.
            </p>


            <h2 class="sub_topic">Prevost Theory of Heat Exchange</h2>
            <p>&#8618; According to Prevost, each substance continuously emits thermal radiations at any temperature.
                With an increase in temperature, the rate of emission of thermal radiation also increases. Also, the
                same substance absorbs other radiation incident on it. If the rate of the temperature of the substance
                increases and if the rate of absorption of the thermal radiation is less than the rate of emission of
                thermal radiation, the temperature of the substance increases. When the temperature of a substance is
                the same as that of the environment in which it is kept, the rate of absorption and emission of thermal
                radiation are equal. The proportion of various frequencies of electromagnetic radiation in thermal
                radiation depends on the type of material and the temperature of the material.</p>


            <h2 class="sub_topic">Perfect Black Body and Black Body Radiation</h2>
            <p>&#8618; body which absorbs all the radiant energy incident on it is called a perfect black body. It is
                impossible to get a 100% perfect black body in nature on the earth.</p>
            <p>&#8618; To study black body radiation, consider a spherical cavity as shown in the diagram. Its inner
                surface is blackened and rough. It has a small hole. Radiation entering this cavity through the entrance
                hole undergoes many reflections and each time it is partly absorbed and partly reflected. When it
                reaches the hole again, it is almost left with no energy. In this sense, this pinhole can be considered
                a perfect black body. If such a cavity is uniformly heated, radiations coming out of it can be
                considered to be black body radiation. These radiations are also called cavity radiations.</p>
            <p>&#8618; The sun can be considered as a perfect black body. Black body radiation depends only on the
                temperature.</p>


            <h2 class="sub_topic">Temperature Measurement Scales</h2>
            <p>&#8618; A device used to measure a unit real number (i.e., temperature) related to a given thermal
                equilibrium state is called a thermometer. Thermometer is used to measure hotness or coldness. The
                commonly used property is the variation of the volume of a liquid with temperature. Mercury and alcohol
                are the liquids used in most liquid-in-glass thermometers.</p>
            <p>&#8618; Thermometers are calibrated so that a numerical value may be assigned to a given temperature. For
                calibration of the standard scale, two fixed reference temperatures are required, <b>the freezing point
                    of water (32°F or 0°C) and the boiling point of water (212°F or 100°C) at 1 atmosphere pressure are
                    two convenient points</b>.</p>
            <p>&#8618; The liquid in glass thermometers show different readings for temperatures other than the fixed
                points because of differing expansion properties of liquids. But the thermometers using gas, at low
                enough pressure of constant volume for the measurement of temperature, give the same reading regardless
                of which gas is used.</p>

            </ul>


            <h2 class="sub_topic">Kelvin Temperature Scale:</h2>
            <p>&#8618; A given quantity of gas having low enough pressure satisfies the ideal gas state equation:</p>
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <strong class="none">PV = nRT</strong></p>
            <p>&#8618; where:</p>

            </ul>
            <p>&#8618; Thus keeping the volume of the gas to be constant, it gives <b>P &prop; T</b>. Thus, with a

            <p>&#8618; It looks like that the pressure approaches zero with decreasing temperature if the gas continues

        <p><strong>Definition of thermometer:</strong></p>
        <p>&#8618; It is the instrument which measures <b>temperature</b>.</p>
        <p>&#8618; There are mainly <b>three</b> scales to measure temperature:</p>
        <ol>
            <b>
                <li>Celsius scale</li>
            </b>
            <b>
                <li>Fahrenheit scale</li>
            </b>
            <b>
                <li>Kelvin scale</li>
            </b>
        </ol>

        <p><strong>(i) Celsius scale:</strong></p>
        <p>&#8618; In this scale at atmospheric pressure when there is equilibrium between pure water and its vapor is
            taken as <b>100°C</b>. This way <b>freezing point</b> of <b>water</b> is taken as <b>0°C</b> and <b>boiling
                point</b> of <b>water</b> is taken <b>100°C</b>, which is <b>273</b> and <b>T=100° + 273.15 ~ 373.15 ×
                373 in Kelvin scale</b>.</p>
        <p>&#8618; If temperature in Celsius scale is taken <b>TC</b> and in absolute scale <b>T</b> then:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong class="none">Tc = T - 273.15</strong></p>
        <p>&#8618; Triple point of water is measured in Celsius scale.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong class="none">T = 273.16 - 273.15 = 0.01°C ~ 0°C</strong></p>
        <p>&#8618; The side is at the focal point of concave mirror. This plate receives radiation from the object to be
            measured after reflection from the mirror. Direct radiation is stopped by putting enclosure round the object
            <b>O</b>. Leads of thermocouple are connected to terminals <b>T1 and T2</b>. Emf produced in thermocouple is
            measured by millivolts. It is the condition that radiation is sharp. For this, <b>(1) Rack and pinion method
                for mirror</b> and <b>(2) mirror with hole in diaphragm is essential</b>.</p>
        <p>&#8618; Hot object is put in front of pyrometer whose temperature is to be measured. Image is focused by
            observing in eyepiece. For this, distance between mirror and metal detector is adjusted. When the image is
            not focused one can observe two images, but if it is focused, only one image is to be seen. At this
            position, voltmeter measures temperature of object at <b>0°C</b>. The distance between object and pyrometer
            is effective as size of image is more than the hole. The pyrometer can measure temperature up to
            <b>1500°C</b>.</p>


        <h2 class="sub_topic">Coefficient of Thermal Conductivity and its Engineering Applications:</h2>
        <p>&#8618; The capacity of a substance to conduct heat is called conductivity. Consider a metal rod of
            cross-sectional area <b>A</b>. Imagine two parallel planes <b>X</b> and <b>Y</b> anywhere in the rod. Let
            <b>θ<sub>1</sub></b> and <b>θ<sub>2</sub></b> be the temperature of planes <b>X</b> and <b>Y</b>
            respectively. Let <b>Q</b> be the quantity of heat conducted normally in t seconds across the plane X. If we
            assume that there is no loss of heat, the same amount will be conducted across the plane <b>Y</b>.</p>
        <p>&#8618;The quantity of heat conducted depends upon the following factors:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The quantity of heat conducted is directly proportional to the cross-sectional area of the rod: </li>
            <p><strong class="none">Q &prop; A</strong></p>
            <li>The quantity of heat conducted is directly proportional to the temperature difference between the
                planes: </li>
            <p><strong class="none">Q &prop; (θ<sub>1</sub> - θ<sub>2</sub>)</strong></p>
            <li>The quantity of heat conducted is directly proportional to the time of flow:</li>
            <p><strong class="none">Q &prop; t</strong></p>
            <li>The quantity of heat conducted is inversely proportional to the distance between the planes:</li>
            <p><strong class="none">Q &prop; 1/d</strong></p>

            <p>Combining we get:</p>
            <p><strong class="none">Q &prop; A (θ<sub>1</sub> - θ<sub>2</sub>) t / d</strong></p>
            <p><strong class="none">i.e. Q = K ∙ A (θ<sub>1</sub> - θ<sub>2</sub>) ∙ t / d
                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp ....... (i)</strong></p>

        </ol>

        <p>&#8618; <b>K</b> is constant, known as coefficient of thermal conductivity, its value depends upon the
            material of the rod.</p>
        <p>&#8618; In <b>equation (i)</b> if we take:</p>
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <strong class="none"> A = 1</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <strong class="none"> (θ<sub>1</sub> - θ<sub>2</sub>) = 1</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <strong class="none"> t = 1</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <strong class="none"> d = 1</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <strong class="none"> &#8618; We get Q = ( K × 1 × 1 × 1 )/1 </strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <strong class="none"> ∴ Q = K </strong></p>


        <h2 class="sub_topic">Coefficient of Thermal Conductivity and its SI Unit:</h2>
        <p>&#8618<strong>Definition:</strong> The thermal conductivity is defined as the quantity of heat flowing
            normally across a unit cross-sectional area of a material of unit thickness in one second, when the

        <h3 class="sub_topic">Temperature Gradient (G):</h3>
        <p>&#8618 The quantity <b>(θ<sub>1</sub> - θ<sub>2</sub>)/d</b>, the temperature difference per unit length of
            the rod, is called temperature gradient. In steady state, the temperature gradient is the same throughout
            the length of the rod. Let <b>G</b> denote temperature gradient.</p>
        <p>&#8618 From <b>equation (i)</b> we get:</p>
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <strong class="none">Q = K ∙ A ∙ G ∙ t </strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <strong class="none">When A = 1, G = 1, t = 1, ∴ Q = K </strong></p>
        <p>&#8618 The coefficient of thermal conductivity may also be defined as the quantity of heat conducted normally
            across a unit cross-sectional area in one second, when the temperature gradient is unity.</p>


        <h2 class="sub_topic">Applications of thermal conductivity:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Ceiling of house is made up of concrete and conducts more heat. To reduce conduction of heat, a wall of
                brick is prepared on the outside of the ceiling and a false ceiling of <b>plaster of Paris (POP)</b> is
                installed inside the ceiling. Thus, the house is kept cool by reducing heat conduction from outside.
            </li>
            <li>Metal handles in doors feel cool in winter, and tiles as well as steel vessels are also felt cool in
                winter.</li>
            <li>Wood and air are bad conductors of heat. If ice is kept in wood, it does not melt for a longer time.
            </li>
            <li>A new blanket gives more heat to the human body as air is trapped in the blanket compared to an old
                blanket. Two thin blankets give more heat than one thick blanket.</li>
            <li>Handles of tea-pots and cookers are made of rubber or wood as they are bad conductors, while the
                remaining parts are made of metal as metal is a good conductor of heat.</li>

        <h2 class="sub_topic">Expansion of Solids, Coefficient of Linear Expansion:</h2>
        <p>&#8618; We know that most objects expand when they are heated and contract when cooling. When an object is
            linear, i.e., it has more length in comparison to thickness, considerable expansion takes place in length
            when heated. This is called linear expansion.</p>
        <h3><strong class="none">Coefficient of linear expansion:</strong></h3>
        <p>&#8618; If an object is rod-shaped and the temperature difference is small, the change in rate of length
            <b>(∆l/l)</b> is proportional to the change in temperature <b>T</b>.</p>
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <strong class="none">∴ ∆l/l &prop; ∆T</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <strong class="none">∴ ∆l/l α<sub>1</sub> ∙ ∆T</strong></p>
        <p>&#8618; Here <b>α<sub>1</sub></b> is known as coefficient of linear expansion. It is a property of matter.
            Generally, expansion is more in metals and their value of <b>α<sub>1</sub></b> is high.</p>
